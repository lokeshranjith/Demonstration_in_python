    "### Q1.What is Reinforcement Learning?How can it be compared with other ML techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "     Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It learns from trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, rather than being explicitly taught labeled input-output pairs like in supervised learning or discovering patterns in unlabeled data like in unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Compared to other machine learning techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data pairs, aiming to generalize patterns to unseen data. In RL, the agent learns through exploration and exploitation of the environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards.\n",
    "     Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns or structures in unlabeled data. RL, on the other hand, is driven by the feedback received from the environment, guiding the agent towards learning optimal behavior.\n"

    "### Q2. How to define states in Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "          States in Reinforcement Learning represent the different situations or configurations that the environment can be in. They encapsulate all relevant information needed for decision-making by the agent. States can be defined based on the specific problem domain and typically include factors such as the current position, velocity, sensory inputs, or any other relevant variables that describe the environment's state.\n",

    " \n",
    "         The Discount Factor in Reinforcement Learning (often denoted as γ or gamma) determines the importance of future rewards compared to immediate rewards. It is used to discount the value of future rewards, emphasizing the importance of obtaining immediate rewards over delayed rewards. A discount factor of 0 means the agent only considers immediate rewards, while a discount factor close to 1 considers future rewards with less discounting.\n",

A higher lambda value includes more distant state-action pairs in the update, potentially leading to better credit assignment and faster learning.
