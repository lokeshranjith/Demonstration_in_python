    "### Q1. What is NLP?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual units called tokens. These tokens can be as small as words or as large as paragraphs or entire documents, depending on the specific task or analysis. Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP as it helps to convert a continuous text into discrete units, making it easier to analyze and process.\n",

    "Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.\n",
    "Removing Stopwords: Eliminating common words (e.g., \"the,\" \"and\") that don't contribute much to the meaning.\n",
    "Stemming or Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.\n",
    "Removing Special Characters and Punctuation: Getting rid of non-alphabetic characters.\n",
    "Handling Numerical Data: Dealing with numbers appropriately, such as converting them to words or removing them.\n",
    "Removing HTML Tags (if applicable): In the case of web data.\n",
    "Handling Missing Data: Addressing any missing or null values in the text.\n",

    "### Q5. Explain Morphological analysis in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological analysis in NLP involves studying the structure and formation of words. It aims to understand the internal structure of words, including their root forms, prefixes, suffixes, and grammatical relationships. This analysis is particularly useful in languages where word forms change based on grammatical features like tense, gender, number, and case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological analysis helps in tasks such as stemming and lemmatization, where the goal is to reduce words to their base or root forms. By understanding the morphological structure of words, NLP systems can better handle variations of words and improve the accuracy of language processing tasks.\n"
