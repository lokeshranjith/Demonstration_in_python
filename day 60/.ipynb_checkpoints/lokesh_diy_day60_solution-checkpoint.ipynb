    "### Q1. Explain the types of Time Series Methods Used for Forecasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of time series methods used for forecasting:\n",
    "* Exponential Smoothing: A simple and widely used method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, with more recent observations receiving higher weights.\n",
    "* ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A versatile and powerful method that combines autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and differencing techniques to model and forecast time series data.\n",
    "* Seasonal Decomposition: A method that decomposes a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components, allowing for the separate modeling and forecasting of each component.\n",
    "* Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks, can be applied to time series data for forecasting, often with additional features engineering and tuning.\n",
    "* Hybrid Methods: These methods combine multiple forecasting techniques to leverage the strengths of each approach, such as combining exponential smoothing with ARIMA or machine learning models.\n"

    "### Q2. What is ACF (Autocorrelation Function)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) measures the correlation between a time series and a lagged version of itself at different lags. It helps identify patterns of correlation and detect seasonality or cyclicality in the data. ACF values range from -1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating stronger positive autocorrelation, values closer to -1 indicating stronger negative autocorrelation, and values near 0 indicating no autocorrelation.\n"

    "### Q3. What is PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) measures the correlation between a time series and a lagged version of itself while controlling for the effects of intermediate lags. It helps identify the direct relationship between a time series and its lagged values, allowing for the detection of autoregressive relationships in the data. PACF values are typically used to determine the order of autoregressive terms in models like ARIMA.\n"

    "### Q4. What is ARIMA and ARIMAX model?\n",
    "\n",
    "* ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): ARIMA is a widely used time series model that combines autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), and differencing techniques to model and forecast time series data. It is defined by three main parameters: p (order of autoregression), d (degree of differencing), and q (order of moving average).\n",
    "\n",
    "* ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables): ARIMAX extends the ARIMA model by incorporating additional exogenous variables (i.e., variables external to the time series being modeled) that can improve the forecasting accuracy. These exogenous variables can capture external factors or influences that affect the time series but are not accounted for in the ARIMA model.\n"

    "* Financial Forecasting: Time series analysis is widely used in finance for forecasting stock prices, currency exchange rates, interest rates, and other financial indicators.\n",
    "* Demand Forecasting: Time series methods are used in supply chain management and inventory planning to forecast demand for products and services, optimizing production and distribution processes.\n",
    "* Economic Analysis: Time series analysis is applied in economics to study trends in economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and consumer spending.\n",
    "* Healthcare Forecasting: Time series models are used in healthcare to forecast patient admissions, disease outbreaks, and healthcare resource utilization, aiding in capacity planning and resource allocation.\n",
