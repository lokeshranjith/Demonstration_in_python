    "\n",
    "The perceptron works by taking a weighted sum of its input features and applying an activation function. If the weighted sum exceeds a certain threshold, the perceptron outputs one class; otherwise, it outputs the other class.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Perceptron algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification. It adjusts the weights of the input features iteratively based on the error between the predicted output and the true output. It continues to update the weights until the error converges to zero or a predefined threshold.\n"

    "\n",
    "Forward propagation is the process of computing the output of a neural network given an input. It involves passing the input through the network, layer by layer, and applying the weights and activation functions to compute the final output. The output is then compared to the true output during training to compute the loss or error.\n",
